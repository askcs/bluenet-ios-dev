# bluenet-example-ios
A small clean project that uses the bluenet-ios-lib.

This exaxmple only has a console interface so you can test the functions from bluenet directly in XCode.

#### Important to note:
The simulator does not support Bluetooth and navigation passthrough so you'll have to load it on an actual phone to see what's happening.
